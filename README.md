# 👋 Hi, I'm Ángel Méndez

I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer with 7+ years of experience building scalable and user-centric applications with **Vue.js**, **TypeScript**, and modern **CI/CD** workflows.

- 🔧 Strong focus on developer experience, clean architecture and maintainability.
- 🤝 Skilled at bridging technical and non-technical teams — I speak both code and business.
- 🧠 I explore the use of AI tools (like **Cursor** and **Copilot**) to boost productivity.
- 🌍 Based in Spain, working remotely and collaboratively across international teams.

Currently working at **DocPlanner** (Tech Team - Payments).
