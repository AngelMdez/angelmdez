# 👋 Hi, I'm Ángel Méndez

I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer with 7+ years of experience building scalable and user-centric applications with **Vue.js**, **React**, **React Native**, **TypeScript**, and modern **CI/CD** workflows.

- 🔧 Strong focus on developer experience, clean architecture, and maintainability.
- 🤝 Skilled at bridging technical and non-technical teams — I speak both code and business.
- 🧠 I explore the use of AI tools (like **Cursor** and **Copilot**) to boost productivity.
- 🌍 Based in Spain, working remotely and collaboratively across international teams.

Currently working at **DocPlanner** (Tech Team - Payments).

### 🚀 Projects I'm currently working on
- **Trainity** – A web and mobile app for fitness trainers and their clients to track progress, workouts, and nutrition, built with React, React Native, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Node.js.
- **Smart QR** – An open-source library for generating dynamic QR codes with conditional rules, deep linking, and a portable TypeScript core with React and Vue bindings.

### 🛠 Future projects
- **Mock API Kit** – A toolkit to spin up realistic REST, GraphQL, and WebSocket mocks with scenarios, network profiles, and a visual panel for development and testing.
